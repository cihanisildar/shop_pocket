# System Design Analysis Report

Generated on 15.11.2025 17:50:19

## Overview

- **Files Analyzed**: 42
- **Components Found**: 0
- **Project Path**: `C:\Users\offic\OneDrive\Desktop\shop_pocket`

---

## Folder Structure Analysis

**Detected Pattern**: `component-based`  
**Confidence**: 100.0%

### Details

- Feature Folders: 0
- Component Folders: 2
- Domain Folders: 0
- Layer Folders: 0
- Total Folders: 18

### Recommendations



---

## State Management Analysis

**Primary Library**: `none`  
**Libraries Detected**: None

### Usage Statistics



### Recommendations

- No state management library detected. Consider using Context API for simple state or Zustand/Redux for complex state

---

## Component Coupling Analysis

**Coupling Score**: 0.0/100

✅ **Low coupling** - Good architecture!

### Highly Coupled Components

No highly coupled components detected.

### Recommendations



---

## Dependency Analysis

### Circular Dependencies

✅ No circular dependencies detected!

### Import Patterns

- **Relative Imports**: 3
- **Absolute Imports**: 0
- **External Imports**: 29
- **Barrel Exports**: 0

### Recommendations

- Most imports are relative. Consider using absolute imports (via path aliases) for better maintainability
- No circular dependencies detected. Good job maintaining a clean dependency structure!

---

## Architecture Recommendations

### state-management

**Current**: `none`  
**Recommended**: `zustand`  
**Confidence**: 57% █████

**Reason**: Projects needing simple state management. Small to medium applications. Preference for minimal boilerplate

**Sources**: GitHub: Growing popularity, Community recommendations
